### üî¨ **Research & Publications**
My research experience spans several key areas of Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing:

*   **Conference Paper:** "Fuzzy AHP Of AI Variables Affecting Supply Chain Sustainability"
    *   *Presented at International Conference on Emerging Trends in Computing and Engineering Systems, 2025*

*   **Book Chapter:** Co-author of a chapter on Laser EDM in the forthcoming book, *Hybridizing Electro Discharge Machining: Mechanisms, Enhancements, and Applications* (De Gruyter, in works).
    *   Contributed to the section on hybrid Laser-EDM processes, collaborating with a team of five researchers.

*   **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning):** "Predictive Modeling of Manufacturing Outputs using ANN and Regression" *(In Progress)*
    *   A comparative study applying machine learning to predict geometric quality outputs (e.g., taper angle, diameter) from process inputs (e.g., voltage, feed rate). This work aims to enhance process control and quality assurance.
